# Assignment_big-data-analytics
MSc Computer Science course assignment involving Python-based data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical analysis. Built and evaluated a random forest model to classify outcomes and extract insights from real-world datasets.


## (A)  Composition

This folder contains several files:-

1. Original Datasets. (apartment_for_rent_test.csv, apartment_for_rent_train.csv)
2. Implementation of python scripts, task-1 specified.  ([Answer] apartment_for_rent_analysis.ipynb)
3. New Creation of cleaned train dataset  ([Answer] 1_general_csv_clean-data_training.csv)
4. New Creation of cleaned test dataset  ([Answer] 1_general_csv_clean-data_testing.csv)
